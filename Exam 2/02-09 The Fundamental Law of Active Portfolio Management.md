### Warren Buffett on Diversification
- Famous quote: **“Wide diversification is only necessary when investors do not know what they are doing.”** -Buffet
- **Key Investment Factors**:
  - **Investor skill**: Ability to pick winning stocks.
  - **Investment breadth**: The number of investment opportunities.
- This lesson explores **how investment performance depends on skill and breadth**.

### Richard Grinold’s Fundamental Law of Active Portfolio Management
- **Grinold's Question**: How do **skill** and **breadth** impact investment performance?
- **Grinold's Equation**:
  - **Performance = Skill × √Breadth**
  - **IR = IC x √BR
- **Definitions**:
  - **Skill**: Ability to predict stock returns. Information coefficient 
  - **Breadth**: Number of independent trading opportunities.
  - **Performance**: Measured using **information ratio** (like the Sharpe ratio, but for excess returns). Information Ratio, manner in which the manager is exceeding the market
- **Key Insight**: **Improving either skill or breadth can enhance performance**.

### Coin-Flipping Casino: A Thought Experiment![[Screenshot 2025-03-19 at 10.54.02 AM.png]]
- **Simulating Investing via Betting**:
  - Biased coin: **51% probability of heads**.
  - Each bet is analogous to an investment decision.
- **Casino Setup**:
  - **1,000 betting tables**, each with its own biased coin.
  - You have **1,000 tokens** to bet across tables.
  - **Choices**:
    - Bet all **1,000 tokens on one table**.
    - Spread tokens **evenly across many tables**.
- **Question**: Which strategy reduces risk and increases performance?

### Risk: Probability of Losing Everything
- **Single-Bet Strategy**:![[Screenshot 2025-03-19 at 10.56.30 AM.png]]
  - Betting all **1,000 tokens on one table**.
  - **49% chance of losing everything**.
- **Multi-Bet Strategy**:![[Screenshot 2025-03-19 at 10.57.54 AM.png]]
  - Betting **1 token on each of 1,000 tables**.
  - Probability of losing everything:
    - **(0.49)¹⁰⁰⁰**, an extremely small number.
    - **Virtually zero chance of total loss**.
- The Bet seems the same but why is the multibet better?
  It is the RISK
- **Key Takeaway**: **Diversification significantly reduces the probability of total loss**.

### Standard Deviation and Risk
- Stedev and risk are the same
- **Single-Bet Strategy**:
  - Standard deviation = **31.62**.
- **Multi-Bet Strategy**:
  - Standard deviation = **1.0**.
- **Key Takeaway**:
  - **Diversifying investments reduces volatility**.
  - Risk is significantly lower when spreading bets across multiple opportunities.

### Sharpe Ratio and Risk-Adjusted Return![[Screenshot 2025-03-19 at 11.04.04 AM.png]]
- **Sharpe Ratio (SR) measures risk-adjusted performance**.
- **Results**:
  - **Single-Bet SR = 0.63**.
  - **Multi-Bet SR = 20.0**.
- **Key Formula**:
  - **SR (multi-bet) ≈ SR (single-bet) × √Breadth**
- **Takeaway**:
  - **More investment opportunities increase the Sharpe Ratio**.
  - **Performance scales with the square root of breadth**.![[Screenshot 2025-03-19 at 11.06.18 AM.png]]

### Three Lessons from the Casino Experiment
1. **Higher skill (alpha) → Higher Sharpe Ratio**.
2. **More execution opportunities (breadth) → Higher Sharpe Ratio**.
3. **Sharpe Ratio increases as the square root of breadth**.

### Real-World Application: Hedge Funds
- **Two successful funds**:
  1. **Renaissance Technologies (Jim Simons)**:
     - Uses **high-frequency trading**.
     - Trades **100,000 times per day**.
  2. **Berkshire Hathaway (Warren Buffett)**:
     - Holds **~120 stocks long-term**.
- **Similar performance despite different strategies**.
- **Explained by Grinold’s Law**:
  - **Higher skill compensates for lower breadth (Buffett)**.
  - **Higher breadth compensates for lower skill per trade (Simons)**.

### Information Ratio: Measuring Portfolio Manager Skill
- **Portfolio Return Formula**:
  - **Return = Market Component (Beta) + Skill Component (Alpha)**.
- **Information Ratio (IR)**:![[Screenshot 2025-03-19 at 11.09.52 AM.png]]
  - **IR = Mean(Alpha) / Std(Alpha)**
  - Measures **risk-adjusted skill performance**.

### Information Coefficient (IC) and Breadth (BR)
- **IC (Information Coefficient)**:
  - **Correlation between forecasts and actual returns**.
  - Ranges from **0 (no correlation) to 1 (perfect prediction)**.
- **BR (Breadth)**:
  - **Number of independent trading opportunities per year**.
  - Example:
    - **Buffett:** 120 investments per year.
    - **Simons:** Millions of trades per year.

### The Fundamental Law of Active Portfolio Management
- **Final Formula**:
  - **Information Ratio = Information Coefficient × √Breadth**
  - **IR = IC × √BR**
- **Key Takeaways**:
  - **Improving either skill (IC) or breadth (BR) enhances portfolio performance**.
  - Increasing breadth is **easier** than improving skill.
  - **Breadth impact follows a square root function**, meaning gains taper off.
