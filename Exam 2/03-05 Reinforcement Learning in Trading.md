### Introduction to Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- **Previous Trading Models**:
  - Forecast price changes â†’ Buy/Sell based on predictions.
  - Lacks certainty estimation and exit strategies.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**:
  - Creates **policies** that provide **specific trading actions**.
  - Helps **optimize decisions dynamically**.

### Understanding Reinforcement Learning as a Problem
- **RL is a problem formulation, not a specific solution**.
- **Robot Example**:
  - The robot **interacts with the environment**.
  - Uses **Sense-Think-Act cycle**.
- **Key Components**:
  - **State (S)**: What the robot sees in the environment.
  - **Policy (Ï€)**: Decision-making function that outputs an **action (A)**.
  - **Transition Function (T)**: Defines how actions change the environment.
  - **Reward (R)**: Measures success of the action.

- **Mapping RL to Trading**:
  - **State (S)**: Market indicators (e.g., Bollinger Bands, stock prices).
  - **Actions (A)**: Buy, sell, hold.
  - **Reward (R)**: Profit from the trade.

### Applying RL to Trading Decisions
- **Environment = Market**.
- **State Representation**:
  - **Stock features** (price, volume, technical indicators).
  - **Holding status** (whether the stock is owned).
- **Trade Execution**:
  - Analyze stockâ€™s past data â†’ Choose an action.
  - Example:
    - **Buy at low price â†’ Hold â†’ Sell at high price â†’ Receive reward**.
- **Policy Learning**:
  - RL **learns when to buy, sell, or hold** based on maximizing profits.

### Markov Decision Process (MDP) in RL
- **MDP Components**:
  1. **States (S)**: All possible market conditions.
  2. **Actions (A)**: Buy, Sell, Hold.
  3. **Transition Function (T)**:
     - Probability of moving from **state S to Sâ€™** given action A.
  4. **Reward Function (R)**:
     - Defines **profitability of actions**.

- **Goal of RL**:
  - Find an **optimal policy (Ï€*)** that **maximizes rewards over time**.
  - Uses **Policy Iteration** and **Value Iteration**.

### Model-Free vs. Model-Based RL
- **Most trading problems lack known transition and reward functions**.
- **Two Learning Approaches**:
  1. **Model-Based RL**:
     - Estimates **T (Transitions)** and **R (Rewards)** from experience.
     - Uses **Policy Iteration** and **Value Iteration**.
  2. **Model-Free RL**:
     - **Learns directly from experience**.
     - **Q-Learning** is a key model-free technique.

### Optimizing Future Rewards in RL
- **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Rewards**:
  - **Soviet Lottery Example**: 1 million rubles over 1M years isnâ€™t practical.
  - **Traders must weigh immediate vs. future profits**.
- **Different Reward Models**:
  1. **Infinite Horizon**: Maximize **sum of all future rewards**.
  2. **Finite Horizon**: Optimize over a **fixed time window**.
  3. **Discounted Reward**:
     - Future rewards **decrease in value over time**.
     - **Formula**:  
       \[
       R_{total} = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \gamma^i R_i
       \]
     - **Î³ (Gamma)**:
       - **Closer to 1** â†’ Values future rewards more.
       - **Closer to 0** â†’ Focuses on short-term profits.

### Summary of RL in Trading
- **Reinforcement Learning Concepts**:
  - Defines a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**.
  - **Goal**: Find a **policy (Ï€)** that **maximizes reward**.
- **Mapping to Trading**:
  - **States (S)**: Market conditions & stock features.
  - **Actions (A)**: Buy, Sell, Hold.
  - **Transition Function (T)**: Market dynamics.
  - **Reward (R)**: Profit from trades.
