# Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and Portfolio Theory

## **Introduction to CAPM**
- **CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model)** is one of the most significant financial models.
- Developed independently by **William Sharpe, Harry Markowitz, and Merton Miller** in the 1960s.
- These researchers received the **Nobel Prize** in 1990 for their contributions.
- CAPM explains:
  - How the **market influences individual stock prices**.
  - The foundation for **hedge fund investing** and modern finance.
  - Why **index funds** exist and the idea that you **can’t beat the market**.

## **Portfolio Basics**
- A **portfolio** is a weighted set of assets.
- Example:
  - Apple (AAPL): 60%
  - Google (GOOGL): 20%
  - Oracle (ORCL): 20%
- **Key Properties:**
  - Weights **sum to 1** (i.e., 100% of funds allocated).
  - **Short selling** allowed (negative weights represent short positions).
  - **Portfolio Return Calculation:**
    ```
    Portfolio Return = Σ (Weight of Asset * Asset Return)
    ```

---

## **The Market Portfolio**
- Represents the entire **market** (e.g., **S&P 500** in the U.S.).
- **Cap-Weighted Index:**
  - Stocks are **weighted by market capitalization**.
  - Formula:
    ```
    Weight of Stock = Market Cap of Stock / Total Market Cap
    ```
  - Large stocks (e.g., **Apple, Exxon**) have a greater influence.
- **Sectors within the Market:**
  - Energy, Technology, Manufacturing, Finance, etc.
  - Each sector reacts **differently to market events**.

## **The CAPM Formula**
The core of CAPM is expressed as:
```math
    Return of Stock = Beta * (Return of Market) + Alpha
```
- **Beta (β):** Measures how much a stock moves **relative to the market**.
  - **β = 1** → Stock moves **1:1** with the market.
  - **β > 1** → Stock is **more volatile** than the market.
  - **β < 1** → Stock is **less volatile** than the market.
  - **Example:** If **β = 2**, a **1% increase** in the market means a **2% increase** in the stock.

- **Alpha (α):** Represents **stock-specific return** that is not explained by the market.
  - **CAPM assumes α = 0 on average**, meaning **all excess return is due to luck, not skill**.
  - **Active investors believe they can predict α**, while **passive investors believe they cannot**.

### **Calculating Beta and Alpha**
- **Beta (β)** is the **slope** of the regression line between **stock returns** and **market returns**.
- **Alpha (α)** is the **y-intercept** of this line.
- A stock with a **high beta** is riskier but offers **higher potential returns**.

## **Passive vs. Active Investing**
- **Passive Investing**:
  - Buy and hold an **index fund** (e.g., S&P 500 ETF).
  - Assumes **α is unpredictable**.
  - Follows the **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)**.
- **Active Investing**:
  - Attempts to **pick stocks** with positive alpha.
  - Uses **technical/fundamental analysis** or machine learning models.
  - **Believes α can be predicted** and used to beat the market.

### **Portfolio CAPM Formula**
For an entire portfolio:
```math
    Portfolio Return = Beta_portfolio * (Market Return) + Alpha_portfolio
```
- **Portfolio Beta:**
  ```
  Beta_portfolio = Σ (Weight of Stock * Beta of Stock)
  ```
- CAPM suggests **alpha is random**, so it is **not a reliable source of return**.
- Active investors argue that by carefully selecting stocks, they can **capture positive alpha**.

---

## **Implications of CAPM**
- **CAPM suggests you cannot beat the market.**
- The **only way** to outperform is by adjusting **Beta**:
  - **High Beta in bull markets**.
  - **Low Beta (or negative Beta) in bear markets**.
- However, **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)** argues that you **cannot predict market movements**.

---

## **Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)**
- Developed by **Stephen Ross (1976)**.
- Expands CAPM by introducing **multiple betas**.
- Instead of just **market beta**, stocks have betas for **different factors** (e.g., industry, economic indicators).
- **Formula:**
  ```math
  Stock Return = β1(Factor 1 Return) + β2(Factor 2 Return) + ... + α
  ```
- **APT is more flexible** but **harder to apply** in practice.

---

## **Conclusion**
- **CAPM explains stock price movements as a function of market trends (β) and random effects (α).**
- **Passive investors** believe markets are efficient → **Index funds**.
- **Active investors** believe they can **predict alpha** → **Stock picking**.
- **Portfolio returns** are mainly driven by **Beta**.
- **Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)** suggests **multiple factors influence stock returns**.

### **Next Steps**
- Learn **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)**.
- Explore **multi-factor models** for better predictions.
- Use **quantitative methods to estimate alpha and beta dynamically**.
