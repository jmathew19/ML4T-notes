# Hedge Fund Strategies Using CAPM and Long-Short Portfolio Construction

## Video ID: ngYW6-mm4jU
Hedge funds develop methods to find stocks they believe will perform well.  
The **informational edge** they seek is usually **market relative**, meaning:  
- They look for stocks that will go up more than the market.
- If the market goes up, their selected stocks should go up even more.
- If the market goes down, their selected stocks should decline less than the market.

If their information is reliable, they can leverage **CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model)** to achieve **positive returns**.

### Example of Hedge Funds Using CAPM  
A hedge fund analyzes two stocks:  
- **Stock A**: Expected to **outperform the market by +1%** (Beta = 1.0).
- **Stock B**: Expected to **underperform by -1%** (Beta = 2.0).

**Long-Short Portfolio Strategy:**  
- Long **Stock A** (buying it, expecting it to go up).
- Short **Stock B** (selling it, expecting it to go down).

If predictions hold true, **market movement becomes irrelevant**, and the portfolio gains a **risk-adjusted return**.

### Example Portfolio:
- **$50 long in Stock A**
- **$50 short in Stock B**

Expected return:  
- **Stock A Return** = Beta_A × Market Return + Alpha_A  
- **Stock B Return** = Beta_B × Market Return + Alpha_B  

Total return expected = **1% gain** on portfolio.

### CAPM Equation Applied to Portfolios  
Using CAPM, the expected return of a portfolio is calculated as:  

\[
E(R_p) = \beta_p \times R_m + \alpha_p
\]

Expanding this:
\[
E(R_p) = (W_A \times \beta_A + W_B \times \beta_B) \times R_m + (W_A \times \alpha_A + W_B \times \alpha_B)
\]

Where:
- \( W_A, W_B \) = Weights of Stock A and B.
- \( \beta_A, \beta_B \) = Betas of stocks A and B.
- \( \alpha_A, \alpha_B \) = Alphas of stocks A and B.

The **goal** is to find weights such that \( \beta_p = 0 \), **eliminating market risk** while maintaining expected **alpha gain**.

### Adjusted Portfolio Weights:
- **Weight for Stock A (W_A) = 0.66**
- **Weight for Stock B (W_B) = -0.33**

Expected return remains **+1%** regardless of market movement.

### Market-Neutral Strategy
By setting **portfolio beta to zero**, hedge funds remove **market risk** and focus on **alpha-based** returns.  
- Regardless of market direction, portfolio gains **1% return**.
- Real-world execution depends on **betas staying stable** and **alphas being correct**.

### Summary: How Hedge Funds Use CAPM Effectively
Hedge funds use **machine learning** and **quantitative methods** to:
1. Identify stocks expected to **outperform or underperform**.
2. Calculate **betas** and **alphas** to construct a **market-neutral portfolio**.
3. Adjust **weights** to **minimize market risk**.
4. Optimize portfolio for **risk-adjusted excess return**.

This **long-short trading strategy** refines hedge fund trading and ensures risk mitigation through **CAPM principles**.
