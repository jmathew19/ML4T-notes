## **Understanding Company Valuation**
- Companies generate **profits** from raw materials and operations.
- The key question: **How much is a company worth?**
- Different valuation methods:
  1. **Intrinsic Value** – Based on future dividends.
  2. **Book Value** – Based on tangible assets.
  3. **Market Capitalization** – Based on stock price.

## **Why Valuation Matters in Stock Trading**
- The **true value** of a company may differ from its **market price**.
- **Trading strategies** are based on identifying **mispricings**:
  - **Overpriced stock** → **Sell opportunity**.
  - **Underpriced stock** → **Buy opportunity**.

## **Intrinsic Value (Dividend Discount Model)**
- Some companies **pay dividends** to shareholders.
- **Intrinsic value** is the total worth of all future dividends **discounted to present value**.
- Formula:
  ```
  Intrinsic Value = Future Dividend / Discount Rate
  ```
- Example:
  - A company pays **$1 per year** in dividends.
  - **Discount rate** = 5%.
  - **Intrinsic value** = **$1 / 0.05 = $20**.
- Higher risk → **Higher discount rate** → **Lower intrinsic value**.

### **Present Value of Future Money**
- **A dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future** due to risk and opportunity cost.
- Formula:
  ```
  Present Value = Future Value / (1 + Interest Rate) ^ Years
  ```
- Example:
  - $1 to be received in **1 year** with **1% interest** → **Worth $0.99 today**.
  - If riskier (5% interest), then **worth $0.95 today**.

---

## **Book Value**
- **Assets – Intangible Assets – Liabilities**.
- **Example Calculation:**
  - **Total Assets:** $40M (factories) + $15M (patents) = $55M.
  - **Intangible Assets:** -$15M.
  - **Liabilities (loans):** -$10M.
  - **Book Value = $40M – $10M = $30M.**
- Represents **minimum company value**.

---

## **Market Capitalization**
- Formula:
  ```
  Market Cap = Stock Price × Shares Outstanding
  ```
- **Example:**
  - Stock price = **$50**.
  - Shares outstanding = **10M**.
  - **Market Cap = $50 × 10M = $500M**.
- **Market price fluctuates** based on investor perception.

---

## **How News Affects Stock Prices**
- Stock prices reflect **investor expectations** about future profits.
- **News can impact valuation**:
  1. **Company-Specific News** (e.g., CEO illness, new product launch).
  2. **Sector-Wide News** (e.g., industry regulations, supply chain issues).
  3. **Market-Wide News** (e.g., economic crises, interest rate hikes).
- If investors expect **lower future profits**, stock prices **fall**.

---

## **Trading Strategies Based on Valuation**
- **Intrinsic Value vs. Market Price**:
  - **Stock is overvalued** → Consider short selling.
  - **Stock is undervalued** → Consider buying.
- **Book Value as a Price Floor**:
  - If stock price **approaches book value**, a potential **buy signal**.
  - If stock price **falls below book value**, buyers may purchase the company for its **assets**.

---

## **Conclusion**
- **Intrinsic Value** estimates a company’s worth based on **future dividends**.
- **Book Value** reflects the tangible worth of a company.
- **Market Capitalization** is determined by **stock market pricing**.
- News and investor sentiment can **cause price deviations** from true value.
- Successful traders **exploit these deviations** to make informed investment decisions.
